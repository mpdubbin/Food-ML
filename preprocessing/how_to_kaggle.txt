Used the Kaggle API to download the dataset
First have to go to your Kaggle profile and create an authentication token
Then put that authentication token (kaggle.json) in your .kaggle folder
    This is a hidden folder in your user/username directory on your Mac desktop
    By using the cmd+shift+. command
pip install kaggle
Then use the command line to find the dataset:
    $ kaggle datasets list
    $ kaggle datasets list -s Food
    $ kaggle datasets list -s Adverse-Food
    The third command returned "fda/adverse-food-events" which I used in the download script (kaggle_dataset.py)
